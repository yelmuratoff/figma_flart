## Problem

The process of translating text styles and colors from Figma to Flutter can lead to several issues, including:

- The need for manual conversion of Figma text styles into Flutter code
- Increased risk of inconsistencies between the design files and the implemented application
- Manual conversion often results in code duplication
- Errors such as incorrect values, typos, or missing styles can occur, which can be costly and time-consuming to fix
- Every time a designer updates a text style in Figma, developers must manually update the corresponding code, which is both inefficient and prone to errors

## Solution

Automating the conversion process eliminates these issues, making the design-to-code workflow more efficient, accurate, and consistent.
